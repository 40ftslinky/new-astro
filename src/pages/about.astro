					<p>Led by Jeremy Nicholson founder and primary creative 40ftSlinky <strong>blah blah blah..</strong>.</p>

					<p>Jeremy has worked in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra for more than 20 years across brand, digital product and print. He has experience in both private (agency land) and public (Australian Government departments and statutory bodies) sectors and serviced local and international clients developing brands, corporate identity, digital presence, applications, marketing materials and publications through his businesses and nom-de-plume (40ftSlinky, Blandmine and Bland Design).</p> 

					<p>After spending the late '90s and early naughties in the publishing industry producing educational materials, marketing collateral and national advertising campaigns, Jeremy spent the next decade creating award-winning covers and layout for books as diverse as dictionaries, true-crime biographies, military histories, literary fiction and mass market fiction (including International Bestseller Matthew Reilly). The last decade has seen Jeremy branch into "ad-land," producing traditional advertising, marketing and brand design, art directing and designing campaigns and products for the education, energy, financial and healthcare sectors. His interest in all things digital has led to a pivot into digital product development, digital strategy and marketing. An experienced CX and UX designer and frontend developer with broad knowledge of industry standard CMS and CRM platforms, social marketing and digital platforms as well as the latest development trends – Jeremy is a true unicorn creative – comfortable in the print world and the digital realm.</p>
